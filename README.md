# Face_Recognition_Using_Eigen_Faces

The code is written in Matlab. 

Eigen faces technique was introduced in the [paper](http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/pca/jcn.pdf) in 1991. 

The algorithm is very intuitive and it is based solely on linear algebra techniques. 

I have written blog on it, explaining how the algorithm works.
